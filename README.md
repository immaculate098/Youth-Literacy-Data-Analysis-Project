The organization needs to understand where they should focus their next project and what strategies to use to have the biggest impact in increasing youth literacy rates.

# Objectives

- Clean and prepare literacy data for analysis
- Identify patterns in literacy rates across different demographics
- Provide insights on where the organization should focus their efforts
- Determine effective strategies for improving youth literacy rates

# Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib - Data visualization
- Seaborn - Statistical data visualization
- NumPy - Numerical computing
- Jupyter Notebook - Development environment

# Dataset
The dataset contains literacy rate information with the following columns:

- Region - Geographic region
- Country - Country name
- Year - Year of data collection
